## Project Description:
This technical project involves creating an interactive 3D scene that recreates a classic children's toy and a customizable lighting setup using the Three.js library. The scene consists of a 3D Mickey Mouse lightbox and a desk-like structure, with various elements that can be controlled and customized.

## Key Components and Features:

### 3D Scene Setup:

- The project utilizes the Three.js library to create a 3D scene.
- A camera is set up to view the scene from a specific perspective.
- A renderer is used to display the 3D scene in a web browser.
- The scene includes a 3D Mickey Mouse figure made up of various 3D shapes and materials.
### Customizable Lighting:

- The scene features customizable lighting using various types of light sources.
- Users can adjust the brightness of the scene's lighting using a GUI control.
- Lighting options include ambient light and multiple point lights with adjustable colors.
### Interactive Controls:

- The scene allows users to interact with the 3D objects using an OrbitControls interface. Users can rotate and zoom the camera to explore the scene.
- A GUI interface is provided to adjust the lighting settings and control the visibility of specific point lights.
### Material Customization:

- The Mickey Mouse figure is made up of different materials, and the project allows users to customize the colors of these materials using the GUI interface.
- Each material can be individually adjusted in terms of color.
### 3D Shape Extrusion:

- The project utilizes extrusion to create a desk-like structure within the scene.
The desk-like structure is customizable in terms of color and material.
### Textures:

- Textures are applied to specific objects within the scene, enhancing their visual appearance.

### External Data Integration:
- Colors were translated manually from reference image, converted to 35 x 32 px array of pixel coordinates, and then converted to CSV file
- The project loads external data from a CSV file and incorporates it into the Mickey Mouse figure.
### Performance Monitoring:

- The project incorporates a performance monitoring tool (Stats) to track and display the frame rate and other performance metrics.
### Responsive Design:

- The scene adjusts to the dimensions of the user's browser window.
- This project offers an interactive and visually appealing 3D scene with Mickey Mouse and allows users to customize the lighting, materials, and more using a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can explore the scene from different angles and observe the visual effects of their customization choices.
